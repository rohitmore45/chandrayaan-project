    <h2>When it Started?</h2>

    <p>
        The spacecraft was launched from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Andhra Pradesh on 22
        July 2019 at 09:13:12 UTC by a LVM3-M1 rocket. The craft reached the lunar orbit on 20 August 2019 and began
        orbital positioning manoeuvres for the landing of the Vikram lander. The lander and the rover were scheduled to
        land on the near side of the Moon, in the south polar region at a latitude of about 70° south on 6 September
        2019.

        However, the lander crashed when it deviated from its intended trajectory while attempting to land on 6
        September 2019. According to a failure analysis report submitted to ISRO, the crash was caused by a software
        glitch.

        Chandrayaan-3 was launched aboard an LVM3-M4 rocket on 14 July 2023, at 09:05 UTC from
        Satish Dhawan Space centre
        Second Launch Pad in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, India, entering an Earth parking orbit with a perigee
        of 170 km (106 mi) and an apogee of 36,500 km (22,680 mi).

    <h2>Orbit:</h2>

    <img src="./assets/images/chandrayaan3orbit.jpg" alt="Orbit Image" height="300" width="600">
    <p>
        After a series of earth bound manoeuvres that placed Chandrayaan-3 in a trans-lunar injection orbit,[34][35][36]
        ISRO performed a lunar-orbit insertion (LOI) on 5 August, successfully placing the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft into
        an orbit around the Moon. The LOI operation was carried out from the ISRO Telemetry, Tracking, and Command
        Network (ISTRAC) in Bengaluru.
        On 17 August, the Vikram lander separated from the propulsion module to begin the last phase of the mission.

    <h2>Landing:</h2>
    <p>Finally Chandrayaan 3 Landend on the Moon On 23 August 2023.</p>
    <img src="./assets/images/chandryanlanding.jpg" alt="Landing Image" height="400" width="600">
    <p>
        On 23 August 2023, as the lander approached the low point of its orbit, its four engines fired as a braking
        manoeuvre at 30 kilometres (19 mi) above the Moon's surface. After 11.5 minutes, the lander was 7.2 km (4.5
        miles) above the surface; it maintained this altitude for about 10 seconds, then stabilized itself using eight
        smaller thrusters and rotated from a horizontal to a vertical position while continuing its descent.

        It then used two of its four engines to slow its descent to roughly 150 metres (490 ft); it hovered there for
        about 30 seconds and located an optimal landing spot before continuing downward and touching down at 12:33
        UTC.

        After landing near the Moon's south pole region, Chandrayaan-3's Vikram lander deployed the Pragyan rover to
        explore the cratered surface, using integrated cameras to send back videos of its environment, and started
        working on the research objectives planned for a two-week stay on the Moon. <br />

        The first video of the rover, posted on 25 August 2023, showed it leaving the Vikram lander on a ramp and
        driving onto the Moon's surface. ISRO also shared video footage from the lander as it approached the landing
        site, kicking up dust as it touched down on the surface. ISRO wrote afterwards that the rover's two scientific
        instruments had been turned on and that it had moved eight meters. <br /> <br />


        A 4-metre-diameter (13 ft) crater, as photograhed by the Navigation camera onboard the rover.
        On 26 August, ISRO posted a new video of the rover driving away, moving almost out of the lander's sight. On
        27 August, ISRO published two pictures taken by the rover three metres (9.8 ft) from the edge of a large
        crater. <br />

        On 3 September, the rover was put into sleep mode after it had completed all of its assignments. Its batteries
        were charged and receiver left on, according to ISRO, in preparation for the impending lunar night. "The
        rover's payloads are turned off and the data it collected has been transmitted to the Earth via the lander", the
        statement said. Chandrayaan-3's lander and rover were expected to operate only for one lunar daylight period, or
        14 Earth days, and the on-board electronics were not designed to withstand the −120 °C (−184 °F) nighttime
        temperatures on the Moon. If the rover and lander were to survive the lunar night, the mission is planned to
        be extended for further science operations. <br />
